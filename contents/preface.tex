This master thesis has been carried out at the \gls{idi} at \gls{ntnu}. The thesis was written in order to fulfill the graduation requirements of the Computer Science program at \gls{ntnu}. I was engaged in researching and writing this study from August 2016 to June 2017.

I would like to thank all the people who have helped me carry out this thesis. Thanks to my supervisor, Helge Langseth, for his indispensable guidance and sincere opinions throughout this work. I would also like to thank two of my fellow students, Simen Selseng and Magnus Gundersen, for keeping me company while writing this thesis. Without them, I would not have made it through the long days at the study hall.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my fiancee, Marianne Gilje, for inspiring and supporting me throughout my studies and our eight years together.

I hope you enjoy your reading.
