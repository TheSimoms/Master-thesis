\section{Betting simulation}

When evaluating a network in a betting situation, the most promising configuration of the network is used. Ten different prediction model instances are trained, as when measuring prediction accuracy.

To evaluate the profitability of the network, for each network instance, four different betting strategies are used:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Fixed bet, with $c_{i} = 1$
    \item Fixed return, with $c_{i} = 1 / d_{i}$
    \item Variance adjusted
    \item Kelly ratio, with  $C_{0} = 0.05$
\end{itemize}
Each combination of model instance and strategy is evaluated over the span of two seasons of the English Premier League. The initial bankroll is set to $100$.

For each model instance, the results for each strategy are presented. The development of the \gls{roi} over the span of the season is plotted. The least profitable and most profitable simulations for each strategy are plotted together with the strategy mean.
