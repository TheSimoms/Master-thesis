This chapter presents the experiments conducted and the results achieved in this report.

Layer sizes marked with * and ** suffered from overfitting. To overcome the overfitting, dropout was applied. * indicates dropout with $p = 0.1$. ** indicates dropout with $p = 0.2$.

For each network, the share of matches that ended in a home victory is presented. Any accuracy above that level indicates the model has learned something other than to always predict home victory as the most probable outcome.

For each network, strategy, and season, graphs present the development of the \gls{roi} generated by the combination of network and strategy over the given season. The graphs show the least profitable, most profitable, and average \gls{roi} achieved.

For each network and season, graphs showing the connection between predicted probabilities and available odds for every feasible bet were plotted. The lower frontiers of the graphs follow the line $1/P_{i}$, as bets below the line are never deemed feasible. If $d_{i} < 1 / P_{i}$, then $d_{i} * P_{i} < 1$, and the bet will have a negative expected gain.
