This section presents the goal of the report, as well as the research questions formed in order to achieve the goals.

The report has one main goal:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore whether football match outcome predictions made by \glspl{ann} can be used for generating a profit from betting.
\end{itemize}

The two following research questions were formed in order to achieve the goal of the report.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What a priori information concerning a football match can be used together with an \gls{ann} in order to predict the match outcome?
    
    Modern technology allows for recording and storing all kinds of information about football matches, teams, players, etc. The number of goals scored, team and player characteristics, and player movement are just some examples of data available. How can the vast amount of data be utilized in order to predict the outcome of a given match?
    
    \item How can the predictions generated by \glspl{ann} be used for generating a profit in betting?
    
    When applying a prediction model in a betting system, there are several different ways of determining whether or not to place a bet, and how much money to place in each bet. The choice of money management strategy can be essential for the system's abilities to make a profit. It is therefore important to explore what money management strategies suit a given prediction model best.
