Association football (hereafter referred to as \textbf{football}) is one of the most popular sports in the world. The sport is played by millions of people all over the world, both for fun and professionally. Even more people enjoy watching the sport being played by professionals, in both national and international competitions \citep{bib:fifa}.

Several bookmakers all around the world allow placing bets on almost every aspect of a match: from the final outcome to which team will be awarded the next throw-in. Predicting the outcomes of football matches is a difficult task. The complexity of the sport, and the vast amount of variables affecting the outcome, increase the difficulty. Injuries, the physical and psychological shape of the players, referees and more; all contribute to the final outcome of a match.

\gls{ai} is as popular as ever, with tech giants such as Google and Microsoft pouring millions of dollars into acquiring \gls{ai} companies (\citet{bib:deepmind}, \citet{bib:maluuba}). This report will explore how \gls{ai}, more specifically \glspl{ann}, can be used for predicting the outcomes of football matches. The prediction models produced will be tested in a real-life simulation, trying to beat the bookmakers in their own game: by profiting from betting.
