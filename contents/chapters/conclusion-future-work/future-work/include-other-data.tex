\subsection{Explore the impact of other available data}

The prediction models constructed for this report utilizes three data sources: player ratings, previous meetings between the teams, and team characteristics. For future development of the prediction models, further exploring the data available at \whoscored\ is a good start.

\cref{subsec:variables-team-characteristics} presents interesting analyses of team characteristics. \citet{bib:bialkowski-lucey-carr-yue-sridharan-matthews-2014} mention how they in the future plan on using their findings for match outcome prediction. It would be interesting to explore the predictive properties the data from \cref{fig:bialkowski-et-al-ball-occupancy} or \cref{fig:bialkowski-et-al-formation-descriptors}. Exploring the predictive properties of the "significance" of different matches, as mentioned by \citet{bib:goddard-asimakopoulos-2004}, would also be interesting.

The team characteristics used in this report are all generated by the match events at \whoscored. It would be interesting check if the events themselves hold better predicative information. By using the events themselves, the middle man is cut out. The underlying events might contain more predictive information than the aggregated characteristics.
